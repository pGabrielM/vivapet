Landing page for a fictional veterinary clinic and pet shop, built as a portfolio piece: responsive layout,
entrance animations and a full translation into Portuguese, English and Spanish.

**Live:** [vivapet.vercel.app](https://vivapet.vercel.app)

## What's on the page

- Hero with animated entrance and key numbers
- Veterinary services
- Pet shop products grid
- Appointment booking form
- Contact form and clinic details

All names, photos and texts are fictional. The booking and contact forms validate input on the
client but do not send anything — there is no backend in this project.
